# Biological Factors of Cancer Creation

It is well known that Ionizing Radiation can cause cancer, high energetic particles can cause mutation in DNA structure that can cause cancers. 
Not so long ago scientist have found that endocrine disruptors (exogenous chemicals that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action) as phthalates (widely spread in across all industries in detergents, lubricating oils, food packaging, toys ...) can cause cancer.

That being said, question for the study is:
Is it possible that any kind of targeted heating of limited area of the body or tissue, can cause disruption of chemical and hormonal activity of the body causing creation of the cancer or its promotion?
Furthermore, as it is known that tumours are created in the body all the time, but body activity are capable of cleaning it, simply by regulating [anti-angiogenesis] (https://www.ted.com/talks/william_li_can_we_eat_to_starve_cancer?language=en), of blood network.

Therefore, blood disruption or hormones, does not necessarily need to create cancer but just to disrupt so much that immune system involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders, does not do proper job.

Equally, as part of same study it should be examined much deeper level, and can different temperature cause malfunction of any CRISPR-Cas9 Proteins causing more likely mistakes in DNA cuts, therefore creating cancers.

This study is there to find can any cm (centimetre), mm (millimetre) or smaller heat area over prolonged period of time can cause organism malfunction on a cellular level. Range of heat should be significant, but also source of heat should include Infrared Spectrum but also Radio Wave Spectrum (also including resonant effects and sudden spikes in radio wave energy).
